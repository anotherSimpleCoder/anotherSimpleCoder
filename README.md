# anotherSimpleCoder

### About me
Yea as my name says I'm just another simple coder, who spends his free
time with programming some stuff here and there and ends up pushing unfinished/amateur projects on here. Yea I guess that sums it up pretty well.

### FAQ
Note: If you have more questions just let me know.

**What programming languages do you use?**
Mainly I am using Python and Rust, JavaScript (as you could see with asbc) and in really rare cases Java/Kotlin (which is 0.1% at times).

**What kind of stuff do you code?**
I'm really into Computer Graphics and Image Manipulation (although I have no clue about it and literally learn it through the internet and the remaining linear algebra knowledge from highschool xD). But sometimes I just write some small tools to get through the day. But now I am also getting interested digital in composition tools (scale_gen, chord_gen).

**What's your "coding setup"**
So this is the software I use to code:
* macOS
* VSCode
* Python3
* cargo

Yea that's about it. And that's I think more about me.

Also here some stuff I'm working at atm (sort of a TODO list):
* A japanese english subtitle translator (news about it coming soon hehe)
